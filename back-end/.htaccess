<!-- If you prefer Apache to set CORS headers, uncomment these. Currently PHP (routes.php) sets CORS to avoid duplicate headers. -->
<!--
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"

# NOTE: Previously this file sent a 204 for OPTIONS at Apache level which
# prevented PHP from adding CORS headers. That behavior was removed so
# preflight requests reach `routes.php` which sets the Access-Control-* headers.
